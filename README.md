This Journal contains a variety of different code that is used to download, process, and analyze ribosome sequencing data. 

## dmel_intro_bioinformatics and Mouse_intro_bioinformatics
Both of these folders contain very similar sets of scripts that are used to to download and process ribosome profiling data and RNA sequencing data from either flies or mice. The description of what each individual step does and 

- Final output. 
This folder contains an example of the final output you will see if you decide to run the read alignments through the RiboDiff package in order to analyze the differential expression between the control and treatment groups. It includes graphs, a table of raw

- Scripts.
